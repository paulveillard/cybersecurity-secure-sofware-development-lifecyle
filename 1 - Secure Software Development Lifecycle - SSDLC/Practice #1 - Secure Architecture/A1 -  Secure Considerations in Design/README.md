# Security Considerations in Design

Addressing security is important at every stage of product development, but it is especially critical to address security
at the beginning of a project through careful consideration and planning. Identifying and fixing security issues at the
end of a product development cycle or after a product release can be expensive, both in terms of the rework cost and
with regard to schedules, deliverables, revenue, and customer good will. Security risks not only come from determined
attackers, but also from innocent oversights in software administration.
